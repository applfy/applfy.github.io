            Few sites are so filled with a sense of history as the Roman Forum (Foro Romano), where, for many centuries, the fate of Europe was decided. Although the surviving remains give only a hint of the grandeur and splendor of the Forum in ancient times, this area, with its columns still standing tall or lying tumbled on the ground, its triumphal arches, and its remains of once-important buildings, are still impressive even to 21st-century visitors - PlanetWare.
